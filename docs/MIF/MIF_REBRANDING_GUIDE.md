## Messaging Framework

### MIF Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"The Mutual Intelligence Framework is a comprehensive approach to ensuring that as AI systems become more capable, they remain aligned with human values and rights. Rather than treating AI as a tool to control, MIF establishes principles for genuine co-development and co-stewardship between human and artificial intelligence. Through ELEANOR's multi-critic deliberation and rights-based safeguards, we ensure ethical decision-making at the moment it matters most."

### ELEANOR Pitch (60 seconds)

"ELEANOR is an ethical leadership engine that operates at decision time—when AI systems are about to take consequential actions. Unlike training-time safety measures, ELEANOR evaluates each decision using multiple independent perspectives: rights, equity, risk, transparency, pragmatics, and contextual appropriateness. It builds machine-readable case law through precedents, escalates contested decisions to humans, and maintains lexicographic priority where rights concerns cannot be overridden by business convenience. The result is AI that respects fundamental values while remaining practical and deployable."

### EJC/RBJA Pitch (Technical, 45 seconds)

"The Ethical Jurisprudence Core is a production-ready Python implementation that powers ELEANOR's decision-making. The Rights-Based Jurisprudence Architecture specification provides complete deployment guidance: Docker containerization, REST APIs, PostgreSQL-backed precedent storage, and operational runbooks. It's designed for real-world deployment with 700+ governance tests, semantic precedent search, and sub-3-second response times. You can deploy a pilot in 30 days."

## Social Media Guidelines

### Twitter/X Posts

**Format:** Short, clear, impactful

```
The Mutual Intelligence Framework (MIF) establishes principles for 
genuine co-stewardship between human and artificial intelligence. 

Not control. Collaboration. 

Built on rights-based safeguards that cannot be overridden.

### LinkedIn Posts

**Format:** Professional, detailed, thought-leadership

```
I'm excited to share the Mutual Intelligence Framework (MIF) - a 
comprehensive approach to ensuring AI systems respect fundamental 
rights and values.

After 27+ years in technology leadership, I've seen how business 
pressures can compromise ethical principles. MIF addresses this 
through:

• Rights-Based Safeguards - Non-negotiable protections
• Multi-Critic Deliberation - Multiple ethical perspectives
• Precedent-Based Reasoning - Machine-readable case law
• Decision-Time Governance - When it matters most

The ELEANOR system and Ethical Jurisprudence Core (EJC) are 
production-ready implementations, deployable in 30 days.

This is about co-stewardship, not control. About genuine 
collaboration between human and artificial intelligence.

## FAQ: The Rebranding

### Why move away from "Constitutional AI"?

**Constitutional AI** is Anthropic's term for their training-time approach. While excellent work, it's conceptually different from our decision-time governance framework. By establishing **Mutual Intelligence Framework (MIF)** as our umbrella philosophy, we:

1. Differentiate our approach clearly
2. Establish independent intellectual property
3. Better capture the spirit of co-development
4. Avoid confusion with Anthropic's work
5. Create space for the community to grow

### What happened to "Constitutional Constraints"?

Renamed to **Rights-Based Safeguards** to emphasize:
- Focus on fundamental rights, not just rules
- Safeguards that protect, not just constrain
- Positive framing (safety) vs. negative (restrictions)

### Do I need to update old documents?

- **New documents:** Always use new terminology
- **Old documents:** Can reference legacy terms with note: 
  ```
  Note: Previously referred to as "Constitutional AI", 
  now part of the Mutual Intelligence Framework (MIF)
  ```
- **Code:** Update gradually, maintain backward compatibility

### Will the GitHub repo change?

- **Organization:** `eleanor-project` (stays same)
- **Main repo:** `EJE` → `EJC` (redirect will be set up)
- **Legacy URLs:** Will continue to work

### What about academic citations?

Use this format:

```
Parris, W. (2024). Rights-Based Jurisprudence Architecture (RBJA) 
v3.0: Production specification for ethical AI systems. Mutual 
Intelligence Framework Project. https://github.com/eleanor-project/EJC

Previously published as: ELEANOR Governance Specification (2024)
```
