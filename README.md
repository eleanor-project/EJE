# Ethics Jurisprudence Engine (EJE)
### A Multi-Critic, Precedent-Driven Oversight Layer for Responsible AI Systems  
**By William Parris — Eleanor Project**

---

## 🌐 Overview

The **Ethics Jurisprudence Engine (EJE)** is a governance-layer system designed to provide  
**transparent, multi-critic, rights-respecting, precedent-driven oversight** for AI models  
at decision-time.

EJE enables organizations to embed **ethical reasoning, safety review, cross-model critique,
rights checks, and consistency logic** directly into their operational workflows.

It powers Version 6+ of the **Eleanor Project**, the world’s first distributed ethical
jurisprudence framework based on multi-critic deliberation and structured precedent.

## ⚖️ Core Capabilities

- **Multi-Critic Evaluation Pipeline**  
  Executes independent “critics” (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, custom rule-based evaluators).

- **Weighted & Priority-Based Aggregation**  
  Merges divergent opinions using configurable weights, overrides, or lexicographic logic.

- **Precedent-Driven Governance**  
  Stores hashed case bundles, retrieves similar decisions, and produces historical consistency.

- **Plugin Marketplace Architecture**  
  Developers can add custom critics with a simple Python class.

- **Audit Logging & Traceability**  
  Full decision trails stored via SQLAlchemy.

- **Retraining Manager**  
  Event buffers, drift detection, and adaptive governance.

- **Live Governance Dashboard**  
  Flask dashboard for real-time inspection of decisions, critics, and logs.
