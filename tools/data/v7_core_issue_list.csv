"[Core Engine] Task 1.1 — Define Evidence Bundle Schema","Description:
Create a formal schema for evidence bundles, specifying critic outputs, metadata, input snapshots, and internal version IDs.

Evidence bundles are the atomic unit of reasoning across critics. A strict schema ensures consistency and safe aggregation.

Functional Requirements:
- Create `schemas/evidence_bundle.json`
- Define critic output fields
- Define justification field
- Define metadata block (timestamps, critic name, config version)
- Define input snapshot section
- Add version tag

Acceptance Criteria:
